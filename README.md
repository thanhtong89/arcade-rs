# arcade-rs

Implements a classic 2D arcade shooter game in Rust, as per [jadpole](https://github.com/jadpole)'s tutorial.
Though he has removed the articles from his [blog](http://jadpole.github.io/), you can access them through
the [Wayback Machine snapshots](http://web.archive.org/web/20160416170529/http://jadpole.github.io/arcaders/arcaders-1-1).

This repository tracks my progress as I work through the steps in his tutorial.
I have tried to keep the commits annotated with each step.

Enjoy!
